In this project I worked on Fake news Classifier using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The dataset that we have is a set of news articles written around the 2016 US election period. We make use of the pre-trained glove vectors to do transfer learning in the second model. Without using these there is a real risk of over fitting as shown in the first model that was trained. At first, we are going to develop the base model and compile it. The first layer will be the embedding layer which has the input of vocabulary size, vector features, and sentence length. Later we add a 30% dropout layer to prevent overfitting and the LSTM layer which has 100 neurons in the layer. In the final layer, we use the sigmoid activation function. Later we compile the model using adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy as loss function since we have only two outputs.
While in the EDA part I have included different plots for the different visualizations of our dataset . During the model prediction I got different accuracies from different models.While the other model accuracies can be increased more using the hypertuning . Some plots which I used for visualizing the dataset are Histogram , Barplot , Boxplot, Heatmap , Scatter plot , Pairplot , Jointplot etc.
